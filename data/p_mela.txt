<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:9pt;">A mysterious traveler, and the anonymous artist behind many art installations scattered across nature over the centuries. He once sought fame and recognition as an artist, but lacked the talent and conviction to make anything meaningful. When the planet's creator deity died, he inherited a fragment of its power, making him immortal. Immortals like him are highly sought after in the post apocalyptic world, so he became a wanderer to avoid being found and confined.</span></p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:9pt;">A stubborn, solitary person. He can be distant and difficult to get along with, but is susceptible to flattery. Ultimately a kind person. He has loves seeing and learning about the world but sees himself as an outsider to it.</span></p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:9pt;">He grew up in Taiyue (Yuan's city). He idolized and resented Yuan equally, seeing them as art personified. His opinion on the deity was complicated, but he eventually moved on after leaving the city. Centuries later, he stumbles upon his old home, which has become an unrecognizable tomb. Yuan is there, though, and they become friends as fellow immortals/Taiyueans/artists.</span></p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:9pt;">A hermit immortal once considered the god of art, and co-ruler of a city called Taiyue. The city thrived for centuries. However, its time came (or so Yuan thought) when the world's creator deity began dying. After various preparations, they woke up in the post-apocalyptic world to find that, somehow, the world had not ended. In their absence, though, Taiyue had fallen. Yuan had always planned to die with their creation. However, for lore reasons they became physically unable to die. With nothing left but grief and guilt for abandoning their people, they are building an elaborate tomb around the city while waiting for their end.</span></p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:9pt;">A prideful being with lofty ideals of what art is. They saw their city as their magnum opus, though they grew to care for its inhabitants eventually. Extremely dedicated to their ideals, often to the point of obsession. Out of touch with the world outside their own head. Despite ruling over humans, they have little knowledge of practical things like &quot;how to use a stove&quot; or &quot;how much could one banana possibly cost.&quot; They are awful at reading the room and struggle to understand other people's emotions.</span></p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:9pt;">Yuan is not human; they are actually the orb, and the body is one of many vessels they can pilot around to interact with the world. They saw their conduct as a form of performance art and took care to dress and act elegantly, playing the part of patron god. After living with humans for a long time, they began to unconsciously adopt their mannerisms. Likewise, the city that began as an art project became something much more personal and precious.</span></p></body></html>
